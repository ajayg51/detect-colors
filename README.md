We will analyze a basic but important tool for identifying colors through a mask. 
We will learn how to detect colors through HSV Color space on Opencv with Python.

```HSV corresponds to: 
* Hue is the color 
* Saturation is the greyness 
* Value is the brightness
```
Understanding the concepts of balancing these three elements, we can implement a basic object recognition based on colors.
